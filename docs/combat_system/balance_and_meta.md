# Combat System Balance and Meta

## Overview

This document outlines the core principles and considerations for balancing The Path's combat system, including character classes, mechanics, and meta-game elements.

## Character Class Design

### Core Principles

* **Unique Mechanics**
    * Each class has distinct mechanics and playstyle
    * Special resources or modified combat interactions
    * Clear identity while maintaining versatility

* **Class Versatility**
    * Primary roles with multiple specializations
    * Different approaches within each role
    * Flexible strategies and builds

* **Synergies and Counters**
    * Natural synergies between classes
    * Soft counters (advantages without shutdowns)
    * Team composition strategies

### Ability Design

* **Cost Curves**
    * Base costs for standard effects
    * Additional costs for special effects
    * Range and AoE considerations

* **Resource Management**
    * Energy costs and regeneration
    * Cooldown timings
    * Stack/buff limitations

## Combat Mechanics

### Core Elements

* **Combat Pillars**
    * Genre: Turn-based tactical combat
    * Time: Strategic planning between turns
    * Pacing: Balanced action economy
    * Feel: Impactful abilities with clear feedback
    * Progression: Character growth and skill mastery

* **Battle Flow**
    * Turn order and initiative
    * Action economy
    * Status effect timing
    * Resource management

### Balance Considerations

* **Situational Balance**
    * Context-dependent effectiveness
    * Environmental factors
    * Team composition impact

* **System Interactions**
    * Transitive relationships (A > B > C)
    * Intransitive elements (rock-paper-scissors)
    * Buff/debuff stacking rules

* **Feedback Loops**
    * Positive feedback (snowballing effects)
    * Negative feedback (comeback mechanics)
    * Power curve management

## Testing and Analysis

### Data Collection

* **Key Metrics**
    * Win rates by class
    * Ability usage statistics
    * Damage/healing output
    * Resource efficiency

* **Analysis Tools**
    * Statistical significance testing
    * A/B testing for mechanics
    * Heat maps for battle analysis
    * Monte Carlo simulations

### AI Testing

* **AI Opponents**
    * Adaptive difficulty
    * Strategy learning
    * Situational decision making

* **Balance Testing**
    * Exploit detection
    * Strategy validation
    * Edge case testing

## Meta Game Elements

### Economy and Resources

* **Resource Types**
    * Health and Energy
    * Special resources per class
    * Consumable items

* **Economy Balance**
    * Cost/benefit ratios
    * Resource regeneration
    * Power scaling

### Player Experience

* **Feedback Systems**
    * Visual effects
    * Audio cues
    * UI feedback
    * Combat logs

* **Player Agency**
    * Strategic choices
    * Build diversity
    * Tactical options

### Meta Evolution

* **Perfect Imbalance**
    * Minor power differences
    * Shifting strategies
    * Evolving meta

* **Long-term Considerations**
    * Power creep management
    * Content scaling
    * Meta diversity

## Class-Specific Balance

### Conjuror
* High spiritual damage, low health
* Echo mechanic timing
* Support ability effectiveness

### Crystal Vanguard
* Defense scaling
* Damage conversion rates
* Team protection value

### Zealot
* Mobility vs durability
* Emotional intensity scaling
* Risk/reward ratios

### The Blessed
* Healing effectiveness
* Divine protection balance
* Support dependency

### Primal Shifter
* (In Development)
* Will need balance considerations
* Role definition pending

## Ongoing Balance Process

1. **Regular Review**
    * Monitor win rates
    * Track ability usage
    * Analyze player feedback

2. **Update Cycle**
    * Identify issues
    * Test solutions
    * Implement changes
    * Monitor results

3. **Documentation**
    * Track changes
    * Record rationale
    * Update guidelines
