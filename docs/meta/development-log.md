## Session 2025-01-09: Character System Definition

```yaml
metadata:
  type: Documentation
  duration: 2 hours
  related_sessions: ["2025-01-08"]
  blockers: None
```

### Focus Areas
- Character class system definition
- AI Development Index enhancement
- Documentation structure refinement

### Changes Made
```yaml
files_modified:
  AI_DEVELOPMENT_INDEX:
    path: "docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_INDEX.md"
    changes:
      - "Added character class specifications"
      - "Enhanced class relationships"
      - "Added balance framework"
    
  character_classes:
    path: "docs/character_classes/"
    changes:
      - "Standardized file naming"
      - "Fixed Crystal Vanguard convention"
      - "Verified all class files"
```

### Key Decisions
```yaml
character_classes:
  - name: Conjuror
    role: "Damage/Control"
    difficulty: "Medium"
  - name: Crystal_Vanguard
    role: "Tank/Support"
    difficulty: "Low"
  - name: Zealot
    role: "Damage/Mobility"
    difficulty: "High"
  - name: Wraithwood_Seer
    role: "Support/Control"
    difficulty: "Medium"
  - name: Primal_Shifter
    role: "Tank/Damage"
    difficulty: "High"
  - name: The_Blessed
    role: "Support/Utility"
    difficulty: "Medium"

documentation:
  - "Established bio files as primary documentation"
  - "Deferred abilities and stats implementation"
  - "Created class relationships matrix"
```

### Technical Insights
```yaml
ai_development:
  - "Class relationships guide AI behavior patterns"
  - "Difficulty ratings inform adaptation strategies"
  - "Combat styles define tactical decision space"

design:
  - "Theme-based design maintains character identity"
  - "Role distribution enables diverse team compositions"
  - "Difficulty curve supports player progression"

process:
  - "Documentation-first approach aids AI comprehension"
  - "Clear class definitions enable parallel development"
  - "Relationship matrix helps balance design"
```

### Next Steps
```yaml
tasks:
  - "Develop detailed class abilities"
  - "Create class stats framework"
  - "Begin combat system integration"
  - "Implement basic class behaviors"
  - "Refine balance framework"
  - "Create test scenarios"

dependencies:
  abilities: ["combat_system", "stats_framework"]
  behaviors: ["ai_system", "game_state"]
  testing: ["basic_implementation"]
