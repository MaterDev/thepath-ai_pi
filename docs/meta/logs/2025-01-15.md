* Added consistent hashtag categories:
  * Documentation (#documentation)
  * Setup (#project-setup, #repository-setup)
  * Architecture (#architecture)
  * Development (#git-configuration)
  * Process (#markdown-formatting, #logging-system)
* Ensured logs are tracked in version control

## Next Steps

* Complete detailed explanations for remaining Phase 1 tasks
* Add .gitattributes for line ending management
* Configure pre-commit hooks
