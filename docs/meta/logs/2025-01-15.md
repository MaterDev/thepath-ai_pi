    * Technical context
    * Acceptance criteria
* Improved organization
    * Individual task documents
    * Phase 1 index
    * Navigation structure
* Updated formatting
    * Proper line breaks
    * Code block styling
    * Document hierarchy

### Navigation Restructuring

* Restructured sections
    * Combined Implementation/Development
    * Top-level Logs section
    * Better hierarchy
* Fixed documentation paths
    * Updated references
    * Corrected broken links
    * Enhanced navigation flow

### Markdown Formatting

* Added proper line breaks between headers and lists across all documents:
  * Phase 1 task documents
  * Project scope document
  * Style guide
  * README
* Improved code block formatting and spacing
* Enhanced overall document readability

### Repository Configuration

* Created comprehensive .gitignore file with categories:
  * Language-specific patterns
  * Build outputs and caches
  * Development tools and IDEs
  * Project-specific patterns
* Configured documentation and log management
* Removed logs from git ignore to track development history

### Technical Implementation

* Added detailed sections for each Phase 1 task:
  * Development environment setup
  * Server environment (Go)
  * Client environment (TypeScript/React)
  * AI environment (Python)
* Enhanced task documentation with:
  * Core considerations
  * Technical context
  * Integration points
  * Phase 2 contributions

### Task Tracking Enhancement

* Implemented detailed task tracking system:
  * Added checkboxes for all tasks and subtasks
  * Created clear acceptance criteria for each task
  * Organized tasks by implementation phase
  * Added progress indicators for major sections
* Updated Phase 1 tasks document with:
  * Clearer task hierarchy
  * Detailed acceptance criteria
  * Progress tracking checkboxes
  * Implementation timeline

### Development Process

* Updated development log format
* Improved documentation organization
* Enhanced project structure clarity
* Standardized markdown formatting
* Implemented granular task tracking

### Logging System Enhancement

* Replaced related_sessions with hashtag system
* Updated all existing log files (2025-01-08 through 2025-01-15)
* Added consistent hashtag categories:
  * Documentation (#documentation)
  * Setup (#project-setup, #repository-setup)
  * Architecture (#architecture)
  * Development (#git-configuration)
  * Process (#markdown-formatting, #logging-system)
* Ensured logs are tracked in version control

* Follow established documentation structure
* Use consistent hashtags for better searchability
* Consider creating a hashtag index for quick reference
* Maintain checkbox-based progress tracking
* Update task status regularly
* Keep development logs in sync with progress
* Follow established documentation structure
* Documentation structure now better reflects project organization
* Navigation is more intuitive and task-focused
* Markdown formatting is consistent across all documents
* Phase 1 tasks are better organized for implementation
