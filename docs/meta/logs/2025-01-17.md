## Technical Details

### Key Configuration Changes

```yaml
theme:
  name: material
  features:
    - navigation.tabs
    - navigation.sections
    - navigation.expand
    # ... more features
  palette:
    # Default to dark mode
    - scheme: slate
      primary: indigo
      accent: indigo
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow

* Uses Python 3.11
* Installs required dependencies:
  - mkdocs-material
  - mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
  - PyYAML
* Runs automatic log updates
* Deploys to GitHub Pages

## Challenges and Solutions

### Theme Consistency
- **Issue**: Theme wasn't applying consistently across all pages
- **Solution**: Updated markdown extensions and theme configuration

### YAML Parsing
- **Issue**: Custom Python tags causing parsing errors
- **Solution**: Simplified superfences configuration while maintaining functionality

### Workflow Permissions
- **Issue**: Initial deployment failing due to permission issues
- **Solution**: Added proper GitHub Pages permissions and environment setup

### Social Media Documentation
- **Issue**: Inconsistent formatting in social media posts
- **Solution**: Standardized format with YAML metadata and code blocks

### Documentation Organization
- **Issue**: Complex navigation structure with multiple sections
- **Solution**: Enhanced update script to handle nested sections
