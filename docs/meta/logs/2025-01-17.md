## Challenges and Solutions

### Theme Consistency

- **Issue**: Theme wasn't applying consistently across all pages

- **Solution**: Updated markdown extensions and theme configuration

### YAML Parsing

- **Issue**: Custom Python tags causing parsing errors

- **Solution**: Simplified superfences configuration while maintaining functionality

### Workflow Permissions

- **Issue**: Initial deployment failing due to permission issues

- **Solution**: Added proper GitHub Pages permissions and environment setup

### Social Media Documentation

- **Issue**: Inconsistent formatting in social media posts

- **Solution**: Standardized format with YAML metadata and code blocks

### Documentation Organization
