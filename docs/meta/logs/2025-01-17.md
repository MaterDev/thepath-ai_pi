### Key Configuration Changes

```yaml

  features:
    - navigation.tabs
    - navigation.sections
    - navigation.expand
    # ... more features

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Theme Consistency**
   - Issue: Theme wasn't applying consistently across all pages
   - Solution: Updated markdown extensions and theme configuration

2. **YAML Parsing**
   - Issue: Custom Python tags causing parsing errors
   - Solution: Simplified superfences configuration while maintaining functionality

3. **Workflow Permissions**
   - Issue: Initial deployment failing due to permission issues
   - Solution: Added proper GitHub Pages permissions and environment setup

## Next Steps

* Monitor GitHub Pages deployment for any issues
* Gather feedback on theme and readability
* Consider adding additional documentation features:
  - Version selector
  - PDF export
  - Site analytics
* Implement automated testing for documentation changes
