# Documentation Formatting and Rules Enhancement (January 21, 2025)

Major documentation refactoring focused on standardizing markdown formatting and reorganizing content structure. Implemented Python-Markdown configuration across all documentation files. Consolidated combat system documentation from individual files into a centralized structure under world_building/. Removed redundant version history sections (29 files) and replaced with monitoring metrics. Migrated AI Development Index to meta/implementation/ai/. Updated mkdocs.yml with streamlined navigation and enhanced styling. Added Windsurf rules for automated log and social update formatting.

## Combat Balance Analysis

!!! info "Analysis Overview"
    Using AI-driven analysis of Schreiber and Romero's "Game Balance" book, we extracted and systematized key balance principles applicable to our combat system. The analysis focused on translating theoretical concepts into concrete, measurable parameters while maintaining the core game design vision.

### Balance Fundamentals

* Core Principles
    * Quantifiable metrics for objective assessment
    * Role differentiation with flexibility
    * Dynamic combat pacing
    * Meaningful strategic choices 
    * Purposeful complexity

### Character Roles

* **Tank** 
    * Focus: Damage mitigation and control üõ°Ô∏è
    * Primary: Defensive abilities
    * Secondary: Crowd control
* **Support**
    * Focus: Team buffs and healing ‚ú®
    * Primary: Healing abilities
    * Secondary: Utility spells
* **DPS**
    * Focus: Damage output ‚öîÔ∏è
    * Primary: Sustained or burst damage
    * Secondary: Self-buffs
* **Hybrid**
    * Focus: Versatility üîÆ
    * Primary: Mixed abilities
    * Secondary: Role flexibility

### Resource Systems

!!! note "Resource Management"
    * **Primary Resource** 
        * Energy (100 base)
        * Universal across classes
    * **Secondary Resources**
        * Class-specific mechanics
        * Unique generation methods
    * **Cooldown System**
        * Major abilities: 3-5 turns
        * Ultimate abilities: 8-10 turns

### Combat Mechanics

* **Turn Structure**
    * Speed determines order
    * Major and minor actions
* **Effect Duration**
    * Status effects: 2-3 turns
    * Crowd control: 1 turn max
* **Action Economy**
    * 1 major + 1 minor per turn
    * Movement separate from actions

### Balance Metrics

!!! warning "Critical Thresholds"
    * **Win Rates**
        * Target: 45-55%
        * Maximum: 60%
        * Minimum: 40%
    * **Match Duration**
        * Average: 5-7 minutes
        * Maximum: 15 minutes
    * **Resource Usage**
        * 70-80% efficiency target
        * No resource waste mechanics

### Meta Management

* **Patch Schedule**
    * Minor: Every 2 weeks
    * Major: Every 3 months
* **Balance Process**
    * Data collection üìä
    * Community feedback
    * Tournament analysis
    * AI simulation testing ü§ñ
