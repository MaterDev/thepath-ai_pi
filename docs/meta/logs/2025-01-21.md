## Session Overview
```yaml
type: Documentation and Infrastructure
duration: 2 hours
hashtags: [documentation-format, python-markdown, windsurf-rules, list-formatting]
blockers: None
```

## Focus Areas

* Documentation formatting standardization
* List formatting improvements
* Version history cleanup
* Windsurf rules enhancement
* Log format standardization

## Changes Made

### Documentation Formatting

* Updated list formatting across all documentation files to use Python-Markdown style
    * Replaced `-` bullets with `*` for consistency
    * Fixed indentation in nested lists
    * Ensured proper spacing around lists
* Removed Version History sections from all documentation files
    * Replaced with Monitoring sections where appropriate
    * Added performance metrics
    * Added resource tracking
    * Added error monitoring

### Windsurf Rules

* Added new rules for log file creation and updates
    * Required review of existing logs for format consistency
    * Added pre-create hooks for new log files
    * Implemented current day update checks
* Added similar rules for social updates
    * Required format review before creation
    * Added pre-create hooks for consistency
    * Implemented update mechanisms

### Documentation Structure

* Updated Python-Markdown configuration
    * Added auto-format settings
    * Configured program settings
    * Applied to all markdown files
* Enhanced documentation readability
    * Consistent bullet point style
    * Proper indentation
    * Clear section hierarchy

## Technical Details

### Formatting Rules
```yaml
markdown_style:
  bullet_style: "*"
  indentation: 4 spaces
  list_spacing: single line
  code_blocks: fenced
```

### File Patterns
```yaml
affected_files:
  - "*.md"
  - "docs/*.md"
  - "meta/logs/*.md"
  - "meta/social/**/*.md"
```

## Next Steps

* Monitor documentation formatting consistency
* Review and update existing logs as needed
* Apply formatting rules to new documentation
* Consider automated formatting checks

## Challenges and Solutions

* **Challenge**: Inconsistent list formatting across documentation
    * **Solution**: Implemented standardized Python-Markdown formatting rules

* **Challenge**: Version history sections adding noise
    * **Solution**: Removed and replaced with focused monitoring sections

* **Challenge**: Log creation inconsistency
    * **Solution**: Added pre-create hooks in Windsurf rules
