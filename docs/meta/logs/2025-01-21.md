# Documentation Formatting and Rules Enhancement (January 21, 2025)

Major documentation refactoring focused on standardizing markdown formatting and reorganizing content structure. Implemented Python-Markdown configuration across all documentation files. Consolidated combat system documentation from individual files into a centralized structure under world_building/. Removed redundant version history sections (29 files) and replaced with monitoring metrics. Migrated AI Development Index to meta/implementation/ai/. Updated mkdocs.yml with streamlined navigation and enhanced styling. Added Windsurf rules for automated log and social update formatting.
