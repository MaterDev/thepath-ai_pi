## Development Guidelines

Each log entry should:

1. **Start with YAML Frontmatter**
    * Include title and description
    * Use consistent date format (Month DD, YYYY)

2. **Have Clear Sections**
    * Session Focus
    * Changes Made (with categories)
    * Technical Details
    * Challenges and Solutions
    * Next Steps
    * References

3. **Use Proper Formatting**
    * Use markdown headers consistently
    * Include bullet points for lists
    * Format code blocks with appropriate syntax
    * Use relative links for cross-references

4. **Be Detailed but Concise**
    * Focus on significant changes
    * Include enough context to understand the changes
    * Link to detailed documentation rather than repeating it

5. **Include Cross-References**
    * Link to related documentation
    * Reference previous logs when relevant
    * Link to specific commits or PRs when applicable
