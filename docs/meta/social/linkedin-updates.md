## January 14, 2025 - Workflow Improvements Update

```text
🐺 Quick update on The Path (AI-Pi):

Added some practical improvements to the development workflow today. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's making the day-to-day work with AI tools smoother:

👉🏾 Set up a Makefile to handle common tasks 

👉🏾 Added scripts to auto-update development logs 

👉🏾 Built a proper documentation site with MkDocs

The doc site is turning out to be pretty useful - it's not just for humans. Having a structured place for project scope, technical details, and development logs helps AI tools maintain context between sessions. The logs especially help track the project's evolution and decision-making.

It's interesting how small improvements to documentation structure can make such a difference in AI-assisted development. When the AI can easily understand the project's scope and history, the coding sessions become much more productive.

💻 On the hardware side, I upgraded the Raspberry Pi case to something more premium. Currently its housed inside of the KKSB PI-5 case, which has space for Hats and the Active cooler

## January 8, 2025 - AI Development Pro Tip

```text
🔥 Pro Tip for AI-Assisted Development

One of the biggest challenges when developing with AI tools is managing complex project scopes within the constraints of context windows and token limits. I've found that maintaining a structured development log is a game-changer for tracking intentions and changes across work sessions.

🐺 Why it matters:

👉🏾 Helps AI tools understand project evolution 
👉🏾 Maintains alignment between docs and implementation 
👉🏾 Organizes work into AI-friendly chunks 
👉🏾 Makes it easy to resume work with full context

I'm using this approach in my current project, combining it with AI-friendly scope docs and technical specifications. I also store the session details in YAML code-blocks, because these are easy to parse and convert into chartable data- in the event that I want to do some data analysis.

Doing this results in a smoother development process with more consistent goals and better-organized tasks. This approach, in addition to well written GIT history, makes for a development process that is incredibly self-referencing.

## January 7, 2025 - Documentation-First Approach

```text
#Wolfpack

🔥 I've been experimenting with a new way to work with AI coding assistants, and I'm ready to put it to the test with my latest project: The Path (AI-Pi), an edge AI game for Raspberry Pi.

Instead of jumping straight into coding, I've developed a "documentation-first" approach that treats project documentation as a direct input for AI context. 

Here's what makes it unique:

👉🏾 I create a comprehensive project scope that serves as a "mental model" for AI tools

👉🏾 An AI Development Index acts as the primary entry point, helping AI tools navigate and understand the entire project

👉🏾 All documentation is cross-referenced and structured specifically for AI consumption

The scope itself becomes part of the development environment

Think of it like creating a "brain" for AI tools before starting development. This solves a key challenge: helping AI assistants maintain context and understanding across a complex project.

I'm documenting this approach as I go, and I'll be sharing insights about how it impacts development with agentic AI tools like Windsurf.

## January 3, 2025 - Project Announcement

```text
🐺Excited to announce my latest project: #ThePath (AI-Pi)!

I'm creating an #edge AI-powered turn-based combat game that runs entirely on #RaspberryPi hardware, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with local AI processing.

🔥 What makes this unique? 

👉🏾 I've developed a novel "AI-First" documentation approach that enables efficient development with #agentic IDE tools like #Windsurf. This methodology allows me to tackle complex AI projects while maintaining context and coherence across development sessions.

👉🏾 Through this project, I'm exploring new ways to make AI development more manageable and coherent, especially when working with large, complex systems that push the limits of context windows.
