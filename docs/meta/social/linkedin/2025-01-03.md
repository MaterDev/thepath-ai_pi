🐺Excited to announce my latest project: #ThePath (AI-Pi)!

I'm creating an #edge AI-powered turn-based combat game that runs entirely on #RaspberryPi hardware, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with local AI processing.

🔥 What makes this unique?

👉🏾 I've developed a novel "AI-First" documentation approach that enables efficient development with #agentic IDE tools like #Windsurf. This methodology allows me to tackle complex AI projects while maintaining context and coherence across development sessions.

👉🏾 Through this project, I'm exploring new ways to make AI development more manageable and coherent, especially when working with large, complex systems that push the limits of context windows.
