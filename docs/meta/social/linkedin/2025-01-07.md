🔥 I've been experimenting with a new way to work with AI coding assistants, and I'm ready to put it to the test with my latest project: The Path (AI-Pi), an edge AI game for Raspberry Pi.

Instead of jumping straight into coding, I've developed a "documentation-first" approach that treats project documentation as a direct input for AI context.

Here's what makes it unique:

👉🏾 I create a comprehensive project scope that serves as a "mental model" for AI tools

👉🏾 An AI Development Index acts as the primary entry point, helping AI tools navigate and understand the entire project

👉🏾 All documentation is cross-referenced and structured specifically for AI consumption

The scope itself becomes part of the development environment

Think of it like creating a "brain" for AI tools before starting development. This solves a key challenge: helping AI assistants maintain context and understanding across a complex project.

I'm documenting this approach as I go, and I'll be sharing insights about how it impacts development with agentic AI tools like Windsurf.
