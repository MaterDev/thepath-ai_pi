🔥 Pro Tip for AI-Assisted Development

One of the biggest challenges when developing with AI tools is managing complex project scopes within the constraints of context windows and token limits. I've found that maintaining a structured development log is a game-changer for tracking intentions and changes across work sessions.

🐺 Why it matters:

👉🏾 Helps AI tools understand project evolution 
👉🏾 Maintains alignment between docs and implementation 
👉🏾 Organizes work into AI-friendly chunks 
👉🏾 Makes it easy to resume work with full context

I'm using this approach in my current project, combining it with AI-friendly scope docs and technical specifications. I also store the session details in YAML code-blocks, because these are easy to parse and convert into chartable data- in the event that I want to do some data analysis.

Doing this results in a smoother development process with more consistent goals and better-organized tasks. This approach, in addition to well written GIT history, makes for a development process that is incredibly self-referencing.
