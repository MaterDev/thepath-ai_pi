🐺 Quick update on The Path (AI-Pi):

Added some practical improvements to the development workflow today. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's making the day-to-day work with AI tools smoother:

👉🏾 Set up a Makefile to handle common tasks

👉🏾 Added scripts to auto-update development logs

👉🏾 Built a proper documentation site with MkDocs

The doc site is turning out to be pretty useful - it's not just for humans. Having a structured place for project scope, technical details, and development logs helps AI tools maintain context between sessions. The logs especially help track the project's evolution and decision-making.

It's interesting how small improvements to documentation structure can make such a difference in AI-assisted development. When the AI can easily understand the project's scope and history, the coding sessions become much more productive.

💻 On the hardware side, I upgraded the Raspberry Pi case to something more premium. Currently its housed inside of the KKSB PI-5 case, which has space for Hats and the Active cooler
