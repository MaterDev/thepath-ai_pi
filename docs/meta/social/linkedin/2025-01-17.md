🐺 The Path (AI-Pi) documentation site is now live!

👉🏾 Check it out: https://materdev.github.io/thepath-ai_pi/

🔥 What's new:

- Comprehensive development logs

- Technical documentation

- Project scope and research objectives

- Social media updates archive

One cool thing about this setup is that the docs are structured to be AI-friendly, helping tools like Windsurf maintain context across work sessions. The development logs especially are formatted with YAML blocks that make them easy to parse and analyze programmatically, should I need structured metadata.

💡 Pro tip:

If you're building AI-assisted projects, consider treating your documentation as a first-class citizen in your development process. It's not just about recording what you did - it's about creating a knowledge base that both humans and AI can effectively use.
