🔥 Quick update on The Path (AI-Pi)'s documentation evolution!

Been working on making our docs even more AI-friendly, and I'm excited to share some practical improvements:

👉🏾 Added structured metadata to all development logs
👉🏾 Implemented comprehensive health monitoring docs
👉🏾 Set up Docker configuration guidelines
👉🏾 Enhanced navigation for better context flow

The coolest part? Our development logs now include session metadata in YAML blocks - making it super easy for AI tools to parse and understand the project's evolution. Think of it like creating a structured history that both humans and AI can navigate effortlessly.

🤔 Why it matters:

When you're working with AI tools, having well-structured docs isn't just about keeping things organized - it's about creating a knowledge base that AI can actually understand and use effectively. The more structured your documentation, the better your AI tools can help you.

I'm finding that this approach is making a huge difference in day-to-day development. AI tools can now quickly grasp the context of any changes, understand our monitoring setup, and help maintain our Docker environment.
