🔥 Quick update on The Path (AI-Pi)'s documentation evolution!

Been working on a lot of editing to fix up my project scope and making the docs even more AI-friendly, and I'm excited to share some practical improvements:

👉🏾 Added structured metadata to all development logs
👉🏾 Implemented comprehensive health monitoring docs
👉🏾 Set up Docker configuration guidelines
👉🏾 Enhanced navigation for better context flow

🤔 Why it matters:

When you're working with AI tools, having well-structured docs isn't just about keeping things organized - it's about creating a knowledge base that AI can actually understand and use effectively. The more structured your documentation, the better your AI tools can help you.
