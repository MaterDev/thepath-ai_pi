Its time for another update for The Path (AI-Pi)! Added two major pieces to our foundation today.

Really excited about how we're integrating Hoodoo, Conjure, and Rootwork traditions as the base inspiration for the lore and mythology. These aren't just aesthetic choices - they're the deep roots that inform everything from world-building to character design. Each element draws from authentic spiritual practices and historical contexts. This is based on about 2.5 years of research and world building on the topic.

Next, I worked on game balance details. Been studying Schreiber and Romero's book and using it to shape our combat mechanics. Created concrete metrics for everything - win rates, match duration, resource usage.

 Documented cultural elements from African, Indigenous, and Caribbean traditions
 Set up proper resource management systems (that 100 base energy though! )
 Defined clear role boundaries while keeping things flexible
 Got those combat mechanics feeling just right

Also cleaned up a bunch of documentation - moved things around, made it more organized, set up some automation. Making sure everything stays clean and consistent as we grow.

I love how this project keeps pushing me to learn and grow in different directions. Every day is a new challenge connecting tradition with technology.

 Pro tip: When building games inspired by cultural traditions, start with deep research and documentation before jumping into mechanics. Understanding the authentic systems and practices first will naturally guide your game design decisions later. Your mechanics will feel more genuine and your world more cohesive.

Quick technical update on The Path (AI-Pi)! Just wrapped up some major code quality improvements that I'm pretty excited about.

 Added autopep8 for automatic Python code formatting - because life's too short to manually fix whitespace. Now our code stays clean and consistent without the hassle.

 Key improvements:
• Automated code formatting with autopep8
• Enhanced flake8 configuration for modern Python
• Streamlined documentation validation
• Better organization of validation scripts
• Added automated log management

 Pro tip: Invest in your development tools early. Good tooling saves time, reduces cognitive load, and keeps your codebase maintainable as it grows. We just saved hours of future work by setting up proper automation now.

The best part? All our documentation tools are now working together seamlessly. From validation to log management, everything just... works.

Been quiet about this, but I'm excited to finally share that this project is built on more than 2.5 years of development that I've been pursuing through art and #GameDev research!

The journey of developing this idea has involved a lot of different tech and tools:

 Started with #Python, building Simulat33 in #JupyterNotebook - where the core battle mechanics and character systems came to life

 Next came huMon-gen for procedural character stat generation - using ancestral tree patterns and data visualization to generate and balance character stats programmatically

 Finally modernized everything with #Golang and #TypeScript - proper REST API and React frontend proving these concepts work in production

Each experiment shaped what we see today:
‣ Battle mechanics and buff systems from Simulat33
‣ Balanced, scalable character stats from huMon-gen

‣ Modern architecture from the Go implementation
