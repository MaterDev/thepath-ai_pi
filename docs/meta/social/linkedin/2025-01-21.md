🔥 Its time for another update for The Path (AI-Pi)! Added two major pieces to our foundation today.

Really excited about how we're integrating Hoodoo, Conjure, and Rootwork traditions as the base inspiration for the lore and mythology. These aren't just aesthetic choices - they're the deep roots that inform everything from world-building to character design. Each element draws from authentic spiritual practices and historical contexts. This is based on about 2.5 years of research and world buiding on the topic.

Next, I worked on game balance details. Been studying Schreiber and Romero's book and using it to shape our combat mechanics. Created concrete metrics for everything - win rates, match duration, resource usage. 

👉🏾 Today's big wins:
- Documented cultural elements from African, Indigenous, and Caribbean traditions
- Set up proper resource management systems (that 100 base energy though! 👀)
- Defined clear role boundaries while keeping things flexible
- Got those combat mechanics feeling just right

Also cleaned up a bunch of documentation - moved things around, made it more organized, set up some automation. Making sure everything stays clean and consistent as we grow.

I love how this project keeps pushing me to learn and grow in different directions. Every day is a new challenge connecting tradition with technology.

💡 Pro tip: When building games inspired by cultural traditions, start with deep research and documentation before jumping into mechanics. Understanding the authentic systems and practices first will naturally guide your game design decisions later. Your mechanics will feel more genuine and your world more cohesive.
