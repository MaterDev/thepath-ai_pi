# Overview of Documentation Scripts

The code for this documentation contains scripts designed to maintain the quality and integrity of the AI-Pi documentation system. These tools automate the processes of validation, logging, and content management to ensure consistency and accuracy across all documentation.

## Methodology

Our documentation system is built on several key principles:

1. **Automated Validation**: Scripts verify documentation structure, links, and content integrity
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Tools ensure uniform style and presentation
3. **Privacy Protection**: Automated removal of sensitive metadata from AI-generated images
4. **Version Control**: Systematic tracking of documentation changes

## Script Categories

!!! note "Image Management (`image_management/`)"
    Tools for handling images in documentation:
    - Metadata scrubbing (especially for Midjourney and DALL-E generated images)
    - Format validation
    - Size optimization
    - Privacy protection for AI service accounts

!!! note "Documentation Validation (`doc_validation/`)"
    Scripts that verify documentation quality:
    - Link checking
    - Format validation
    - Structure verification
    - Content integrity checks

!!! note "Log Management (`log_management/`)"
    Tools for maintaining development logs:
    - Log file creation and updates
    - Format standardization
    - Content organization
    - Automated navigation updates

## Best Practices

1. Run validation scripts before committing changes
2. Always check images for metadata using `make check-images`
3. Keep logs updated with significant changes
4. Follow the established documentation structure
