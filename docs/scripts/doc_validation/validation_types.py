"""
Common types and structures for documentation validation.

This module provides the core data structures used throughout the documentation
validation system. It defines:

1. Severity levels for validation issues
2. Structured validation issue representation
3. Validation result collection and statistics

These types ensure consistent handling of validation results across all validators
and provide a unified way to report and track documentation issues.
