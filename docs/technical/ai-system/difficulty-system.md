# Difficulty System

## Overview

The difficulty system provides dynamic adjustment of AI behavior based on:
- Player skill level
- Game progression
- Strategic depth
- Hardware capabilities

## Core Components

### Difficulty Levels

```python
class DifficultyLevel:
    """Base difficulty settings"""
    BEGINNER = 0.4    # More random actions, basic strategy
    NORMAL = 0.7      # Balanced decision making
    HARD = 0.85      # Optimal strategy focus
    EXPERT = 1.0     # Maximum performance

class DifficultyProfile:
    """Complete difficulty configuration"""
    def __init__(self, base_level: float):
        self.base_level = base_level
        self.strategy_weights = self._calculate_weights()
        self.exploration_rate = self._calculate_exploration()
        self.performance_limit = self._calculate_performance()
    
    def _calculate_weights(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate strategy weights based on difficulty"""
        return {
            'offensive': self.base_level * 1.2,
            'defensive': self.base_level * 0.8,
            'tactical': self.base_level * 1.0,
            'random': (1 - self.base_level) * 0.5
        }
```

### Dynamic Adjustment

```python
class DynamicAdjuster:
    """Adjusts difficulty based on gameplay"""
    def __init__(self,
                 initial_difficulty: float,
                 adjustment_rate: float = 0.1):
        self.current_difficulty = initial_difficulty
        self.adjustment_rate = adjustment_rate
        self.performance_history = []
    
    def update(self, game_result: GameResult) -> float:
        """Update difficulty based on game result"""
        # Calculate performance metric
        performance = self._calculate_performance(game_result)
        self.performance_history.append(performance)
        
        # Adjust difficulty
        if len(self.performance_history) >= 3:
            avg_performance = np.mean(self.performance_history[-3:])
            self._adjust_difficulty(avg_performance)
        
        return self.current_difficulty
    
    def _adjust_difficulty(self, performance: float):
        """Adjust difficulty based on performance"""
        target = 0.6  # Target win rate
        difference = target - performance
        
        # Apply adjustment with bounds
        adjustment = difference * self.adjustment_rate
        self.current_difficulty = np.clip(
            self.current_difficulty + adjustment,
            DifficultyLevel.BEGINNER,
            DifficultyLevel.EXPERT
        )
```

## Performance Metrics

```python
@dataclass
class GameResult:
    """Game outcome and performance metrics"""
    victory: bool
    turns_taken: int
    damage_dealt: int
    damage_received: int
    optimal_plays: int
    total_plays: int
    
    def calculate_performance(self) -> float:
        """Calculate overall performance metric"""
        metrics = {
            'victory': float(self.victory),
            'turn_efficiency': 1.0 - (self.turns_taken / 20),
            'damage_ratio': self.damage_dealt / 
                          (self.damage_received + 1),
            'optimal_ratio': self.optimal_plays / self.total_plays
        }
        
        weights = {
            'victory': 0.4,
            'turn_efficiency': 0.2,
            'damage_ratio': 0.2,
            'optimal_ratio': 0.2
        }
        
        return sum(metric * weights[key] 
                  for key, metric in metrics.items())
```

## Implementation Guidelines

For AI-assisted development:

1. **Difficulty Integration**
   ```python
   class AIAgent:
       def __init__(self, difficulty_profile: DifficultyProfile):
           self.difficulty = difficulty_profile
           self.model = self._load_model()
       
       def select_action(self,
                        state: dict,
                        valid_actions: List[Action]) -> Action:
           """Select action based on difficulty"""
           # Get base action scores
           scores = self.model.predict(state)
           
           # Apply difficulty modifiers
           modified_scores = self._apply_difficulty(
               scores,
               valid_actions
           )
           
           # Add exploration noise
           if random.random() < self.difficulty.exploration_rate:
               return random.choice(valid_actions)
           
           return valid_actions[np.argmax(modified_scores)]
   ```

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   ```python
   class PerformanceMonitor:
       """Monitors AI performance metrics"""
       def __init__(self):
           self.metrics = defaultdict(list)
       
       def record_action(self,
                        action: Action,
                        state: dict,
                        outcome: ActionOutcome):
           """Record action performance"""
           metrics = {
               'action_type': action.type,
               'state_score': evaluate_state(state),
               'outcome_score': evaluate_outcome(outcome),
               'processing_time': outcome.processing_time
           }
           
           for key, value in metrics.items():
               self.metrics[key].append(value)
       
       def get_summary(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
           """Get performance summary"""
           return {
               key: np.mean(values)
               for key, values in self.metrics.items()
           }
   ```

3. **Hardware Considerations**
   ```python
   def adjust_for_hardware(difficulty: DifficultyProfile) -> DifficultyProfile:
       """Adjust difficulty based on hardware capabilities"""
       # Check available memory
       memory = psutil.virtual_memory()
       if memory.percent > 80:
           difficulty.performance_limit *= 0.8
       
       # Check CPU temperature
       temperature = get_cpu_temperature()
       if temperature > 70:
           difficulty.performance_limit *= 0.7
       
       return difficulty
   ```
